Yeah so i was confused as to how to upgrade anything until i had already reached the first 1000 clicks. Also the upgrade should be something that the player feels is worth their time and clicks. The easiest way is to give them a big boost in clicks but increase the upgrade amounts. That way they're still clicking about as ofter but they feel like they're making more or faster progress often. Oh looks like you already did that later on. Ok. So the only other thing would be to make some sort of goal or reason that you are clicking it. So like you are a delivery boy or something and you are stacking donuts or something. Roleplay tends to keep people hooked a little longer. And an added animation when you click makes the click more rewarding.

\cf2 I'd also do some added upgrades. If you've ever played clicker hero they have a good click based game. You could also do rewards or trophies for long term appeal.\

JS. Mmm\'85 Donuts\
\
BPM: My finger is very tired now. I\'92ll have to show this to my kids maybe they will keep going where I have stopped\
\
Whitney Teagle: So you just click the donut as much as you can? Hand Cramp. What is the point of this game? Maybe if it was more like back a mole, where it just starts popping up. It might be better\
\
Sherry Teagle: I like the donut it was very responsive. It would be nice to have some kind of activities to go with it. I tried to reopen the web page after closing out and reopening mobile safari and it wouldn\'92t load.\

Regan Ross: I think I already beat your game. ((have attached image))\
